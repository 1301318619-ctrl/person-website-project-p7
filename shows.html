        I love animes so much and I have too many favorites I can't choose because they're all good.

        My Hero Academia is about Izuku Midoriya, 
        a boy without superpowers in a world where most people have them, who dreams of becoming a hero. 
        After being granted powers by the world's greatest hero, All Might, he enrolls in a prestigious high school for heroes to train and learn what it truly means to be a hero,
         facing villans and the complexities of the hero society along the way.
